Kaspersky Neuromorphic Platform (also referred to as "the platform") is a software and hardware platform designed to emulate spiking neural networks and support them on various computers.

You can use Kaspersky Neuromorphic Platform to do the following:

- Create and train neural networks based on the various types of input data, such as telemetry, events, images, 3D data, audio data and tactile data.
- Optimize the structure and hyperparameters of loaded neural networks.
- Conduct applied research in the field of input data classification and other application domains of spiking neural networks.
- Develop new topologies of neural networks, such as spike analogs of convolutional neural networks that imply convolution in space and time.
- Develop new models of synaptic plasticity.
- Implement new neuron models.
- Implement application solutions based on neuromorphic spiking neural networks and artificial intelligence in the field of robotic manipulators, Internet of Things, unmanned systems, human-machine interaction, wearable devices, and optimization planning.
- Implement application solutions on devices with low power consumption or using neural processing units (NPU).

You can use the C++ and Python languages to accomplish these tasks. The platform supports CPU. The Kaspersky Neuromorphic Platform framework can also be used as a backend for the PyNN API.
