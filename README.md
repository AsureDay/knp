Kaspersky Neuromorphic Platform (also referred to as KNP or "the platform") is a software platform designed to emulate spiking neural networks and support them on various computers. 

You can use Kaspersky Neuromorphic Platform to do the following:

- Create spiking neural networks and train them on various types of input data, such as telemetry, events, images, 3D data, audio data and tactile data.
- Convert artificial neural networks (ANN) into spiking neural networks and train them.
- Optimize the structure of loaded neural networks.
- Conduct applied research in the field of input data classification and other application domains of neural networks.
- Develop new topologies of neural networks, such as spike analogs of convolutional neural networks that imply convolution in space and time.
- Develop new models of synaptic plasticity.
- Implement new neuron models.
- Implement application solutions based on neuromorphic spiking neural networks in the field of robotic manipulators, Internet of Things, unmanned systems, human-machine interaction, wearable devices, and optimization planning.
- Implement application solutions on devices with low power consumption or using neuromorphic processors. 

You can use the C++ and Python languages to accomplish these tasks. The platform supports CPU as well as neuromorphic processor AltAI-1 designed got energy-efficient execution of neural networks in various types of intelligent devices.
