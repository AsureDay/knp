# Implementation of image classification of handwritten numbers from the MNIST database

`main.cpp` contains implementation of neural network that classifies images of handwritten numbers from the MNIST database.

_Image classification of handwritten numbers from the MNIST database consists of the following steps_:

1.  Header files required for the neural network execution are included using the `#include` directive.
2.  The `main` function is implemented that loads a network and runs it or shows a subgraph of it depending on the specified task type.

    The `main` function implements the following:
    
    1.  Creates an output ID.
    2.  Defines `std::string` objects for task types, path to network and path to file storing data. 
    3.  Defines option values for task types, path to network and path to file storing data.
    4.  Creates an object that stores the defined options in the variable map. 
    5.  Defines the `main` function behavior if a path to network is not provided.
    6.  Defines the `main` function behavior if it is called to show a network subgraph. If the function is called to show a network subgraph, the `main` function does the following:
        1.  Defines a path to network using a variable map.
        2.  Creates a network object and loads it from the defined path using the `sonata` namespace functions.
        3.  Creates a network graph using the `NetworkGraph` structure.
        4.  Prints descriptions of graph connections using the `print_network_description` function. 
        5.  Draws a subgraph using the `position_network_test` function.
    7. Defines the `main` function behavior if it is called to run inference (classify images). If the function is called to run inference, the `main` function does the following:
        1.  Defines a path to backend.
        2.  Runs model inference using the `do_inference` function.
