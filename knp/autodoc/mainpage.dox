\tableofcontents

Kaspersky Neuromorphic Platform (also referred to as "the platform") is a software and hardware platform designed to emulate spiking neural networks and support them on various computers.
You can use Kaspersky Neuromorphic Platform to do the following:
\li Create and train neural networks based on the various types of input data, such as telemetry, events, images, 3D data, audio data and tactile data.
\li Optimize the structure and hyperparameters of loaded neural networks.
\li Conduct applied research in the field of input data classification and other application domains of spiking neural networks.
\li Develop new topologies of neural networks, such as spike analogs of convolutional neural networks that imply convolution in space and time.
\li Develop new models of synaptic plasticity.
\li Implement new neuron models.
\li Implement application solutions based on neuromorphic spiking neural networls in the field of robotic manipulators, Internet of Things, unmanned systems, human-machine interaction, wearable devices, and optimization planning.
\li Implement application solutions on devices with low power consumption or using neural processing units (NPU).
You can use the C++ and Python languages to accomplish these tasks. The platform supports CPU. The Kaspersky Neuromorphic Platform framework can also be used as a backend for the PyNN API.
