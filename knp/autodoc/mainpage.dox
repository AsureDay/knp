@mainpage About Kaspersky Neuromorphic Platform

@tableofcontents

The Kaspersky Neuromorphic Platform ("KNP" or "platform") is a software platform for developing, training and executing spiking neural networks on a variety of computers. 
You can use Kaspersky Neuromorphic Platform to do the following:
@li Create spiking neural networks and train these on various types of input data, such as telemetry, events, images, 3D data, audio, and tactile data.
@li Convert artificial neural networks (ANN) into spiking networks and train these.
@li Optimize the structure of the loaded neural networks.
@li Conduct applied research in the field of input data classification and other application domains of neural networks.
@li Develop new neural network topologies, for example, impulse analogs of convolutional neural networks that involve convolution in space and time.
@li Develop new models of synaptic plasticity.
@li Implement new neuron models.
@li Implement application solutions based on neuromorphic spiking neural networks in the field of robotic manipulators, Internet of Things, unmanned systems, human-machine interaction, wearable devices, and optimization planning.
@li Implement application solutions on devices with low power consumption or using neuromorphic processors.

You can use the C++ and Python languages to accomplish these tasks. The platform supports CPU as well as neuromorphic processor AltAI-1 designed for energy-efficient execution of neural networks in various types of intelligent devices.
